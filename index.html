We've taken down the DefiLlama Aggregator, we'll soon launch it again in a much improved version.<br>
<br>
The aggregator was in pre-alpha state, however people chose to use it and there were a few cases where users swapped highly illiquid assets in niche chains, resulting in losses due to large slippage.<br>
These could have been prevented if the aggregator displayed warnings in such situations, so to prevent any future losses we've decided to take it down for now as we work on building more safety rails, and we've refunded everyone that experienced a loss.<br>
<br>
We'll soon launch an improved version for everyone to use!
